# aws-vpc-ec2-network-lab
A hands-on AWS networking lab simulating a real-world IT support scenario. I built a VPC with a public subnet, Internet Gateway, and EC2 instance to troubleshoot DNS and connectivity issues, similar to problems I see in my support role.  Tools: AWS VPC, Subnet, Route Tables, EC2, Git Bash, SSH.
