# AWS VPC + EC2 Networking Lab

This project simulates a real-world IT issue I encountered while working as a Service Ticket Coordinator at an IT healthcare company. It walks through building a custom cloud network in AWS using a VPC, public subnet, Internet Gateway, and EC2 instance, then validating connectivity using real troubleshooting steps.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to build an isolated AWS VPC with internet access
- How to launch and connect to a secure EC2 instance
- How DNS resolution works in the cloud and what happens when it fails
- How this maps to real-world IT support scenarios

## 💻 Technologies Used

- AWS VPC, Subnet, IGW, EC2
- Git Bash for SSH
- Amazon Linux 2
- Route Tables + Public IP setup

## 🔐 Skills Demonstrated

- Cloud networking
- DNS troubleshooting
- SSH access using key pairs
- System monitoring and connectivity validation

## 🛠️ Commands Used

- `ping google.com`
- `cat /etc/resolv.conf`
- `ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<EC2-IP>`
